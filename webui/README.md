# Web UI

## About

`webui` is a website framework for building webassembly SPA websites quickly and easily.

## Goals

- Minimize boilerplate code when starting new website projects.
- Adhere to Material UI standards.
- Provide robust component systems for handling common display types, user input and interactions, and data processing.

Development is just getting started, so we do not recommend using at this point for anything more than experimenting.
