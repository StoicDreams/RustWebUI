Welcome to the Web UI toolkit.

Web UI at it's core is a collection of Vanilla JavaScript based Web Components.

We chose to use Vanilla JavaScript as we find developing with JavaScript to be far more productive versus any other languages or frameworks. And it doesn't hurt that this also makes it virtually seemless to integrate Web UI components into any existing website, regardless of how it's build.

That said, Web UI is not intended to be any kind of one-kind-fits-all library. It is a very opinionated library. It is expected that if a web component does not work how you think it should, then you can copy the component to your own library and modify it there to your hearts content.

Source code for all Web UI web components can be found in our [MyFiCDN Repo on GitHub](https://github.com/StoicDreams/MyFiCDN/tree/main/cdn/webui).

Out concept for Web UI actually began with wanting to build a component library for Rust when we decided to switch our development from C# tech stacks to Rust tech stacks.

While we found Rust to be much faster and easier to work with versus C#, we still found the developer experience severily lacking when compared to our previous years of developing frontends using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

And then earlier in 2024 we discovered Web Components. A browser/JavaScript native method of creating custom html elements. How had we missed this? Since this discovery we have retooled our Web UI concept to be strict JavaScript/HTML/CSS at its core. While also rethinking how we will connect with Rust WebAssembly to offload work for specific tasks.

Web UI is very much early in development, and our documentation is very minimal as we development of Web UI is in very experimental stages and prone to rapid changes, such as our recent move to making Web UI a Vanilla JavaScript component library instead of a Rust Framework.

<webui-card name="Getting Started" width="500" theme="tertiary" avatar="duotone star">

Web UI is very early in development, as I just started working on Web UI on Sept 28th, 2022. And then made the decision to switch Web UI from being a Rust-based framework to a pure Vanilla JavaScript component library on June 8th, 2024. And all the while only working on this project part time, sometimes only spending a few hours a week, other times going months without touching it.

Expect rapid iteration style development with breaking changes, even in patch version updates, prior to releasing a 1.0 version, which may be sometime in 2025 depending on my prioritizations between this and other passion projects and priorities.

Please note that updates may be very slow. I work on this along with my other passion projects on a very part time basis, sometimes only putting in a few hours a week, and sometimes going weeks or even months without doing any work. I wish I could work on this stuff full time so I could deliver new features daily, but that's just not in the cards at this point in time.

Web UI is currently being used for this website, as well as all of my other Stoic Dreams websites.

If you are fine dealing with frequent breaking changes and would like to start using Web UI for your project, I would appreciate you letting me know what you think about Web UI and what you would like to see in it through either <a data-click="feedback">a Feedback message</a> or in [the Stoic Dreams discord server](https://discord.com/channels/972856291909332993/1025781071608037466 "Web UI at Stoic Dreams Discord server") to help me prioritize features and updates based on what people want from Web UI.

I will be updating this website to provide full documentation, but for now you can check out [our Rust-built documentation](https://crates.io/crates/webui "Web UI rust crate documentation").

<webui-card name="Where is the Documentation" width="500" theme="tertiary" avatar="duotone star">

I expect you may be wondering where this website doesn't contain much documentation. And if you look into the source code you will see more publicly accessible features and components that aren't documented here.

The reason is quite simple. Web UI is very early in development, and a lot of the work I am doing is experimental and subject to frequent changes or entire re-writes or removal. Additionally, I am working on this project, along with several other personal projects, on a part-time basis, with my full-time job and family time taking higher priorities.

For these reasons, I have decided to only document features and components once I feel they are ready to be used.

Of course, this doesn't mean I won't still drastically change a feature or component if it's documented. But expect that if I do change a documented feature or component, that the associated documentation will be updated with the change.
