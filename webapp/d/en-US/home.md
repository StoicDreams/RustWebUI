# Welcome to the Web UI documentation and demo website

I am very excited to be sharing this tool with you, as well as my journey into the world of Rust development.

One of my last major projects at Stoic Dreams was working on a UI framework utilizing the C# Blazor framework, which allows for C# code and Razor pages to be compiled to webassembly, thus allowing for C# native libraries and code to be used for developing front-end web applications.

Blazor was a very interesting framework for me, as I have always loved the C# language and I was very excited by the prospect of getting to use if for both front-end and back-end development.

But Blazor is not without it's major issues, which I will not dive into here. But, you can check out my [Blazor UI project](https://blazorui.stoicdreams.com "Blazor UI documentation and website demo") to see for yourself the differences between it and what I am accomplishing here.

But then I was introduced to Rust. A language that has the power of C and C++ languages, but removes many of the pitfalls and barriers to entry that I had with those languages. A language with features such as thread and memory safety built in, and no garbage collection.

And doing more research into the language, I found that it has a robust and rapidly growing community of developers that are passionate about the language and the power and safety it provides developers.

Then as I was digging more into the language I discover it has documentation and testing systems built into the language, that make it much easier to self document code in a manner that is easily consumable, as well as much easier to manage testing, such as the ability to write tests as part of the documentation so they serve as both an example for other developers, as well as a unit test to verify your code is working - which also assures your documentation stays up to date as you make changes.

So then after much consideration and evaluation, I made the decision to jump in and commit to Rust, re-writing all of my C# projects to be powered by Rust.

And so far I are very glad I made this decision.

I have fallen in love with Rust, and for a very simple reason. It's the most productive language that I have ever used.

What do I mean by this? Well, Rust is fast. Super fast. And it makes me very fast to develop and update features in a project.

And since Rust is so strict about compilation errors, this means that most bugs are caught by the compiler, giving me immediate feedback on not only the problem, but many times helpful solutions to fix the problem.

This feedback loop being so short, means problems are identified and resolved in much shorter cycles. Which then translates to me being able to create software that works in faster iteration cycles.

Web UI is very early in development, as I just started working on Web UI on Sept 28th, 2022.

Expect rapid iteration style development with breaking changes, even in patch version updates, prior to releasing a 1.0 version, which may be sometime in 2024 depending on my prioritizations between this and other passion projects and priorities.

Please note that updates may be very slow. I work on this along with my other passion projects on a very part time basis, sometimes only putting in a few hours a week, and sometimes going weeks without doing any work. I wish I could work on this stuff full time so I could deliver new features daily, but that's just not in the cards at this point in time.

Web UI is currently being used for this website, as well as all of my other Stoic Dreams websites.

If you are fine dealing with frequent breaking changes and would like to start using Web UI for your project, I would appreciate you letting me know what you think about Web UI and what you would like to see in it through either a Feedback message or in [the Stoic Dreams discord server](https://discord.com/channels/972856291909332993/1025781071608037466 "Web UI at Stoic Dreams Discord server") to help me prioritize features and updates based on what people want from Web UI.

I will be updating this website to provide full documentation, but for now you can check out [our Rust-built documentation](https://crates.io/crates/webui "Web UI rust crate documentation").
```

```card "Where is the Documentation" "500" "tertiary" "fa-duotone fa-books"
I expect you may be wondering where this website doesn't contain much documentation. And if you look into the source code you will see more publicly accessible features and components that aren't documented here.

The reason is quite simple. Web UI is very early in development, and a lot of the work I am doing is experimental and subject to frequent changes or entire re-writes or removal. Additionally, I am working on this project, along with several other personal projects, on a part-time basis, with my full-time job and family time taking higher priorities.

For these reasons, I have decided to only document features and components once I feel they are ready to be used.

Of course, this doesn't mean I won't still drastically change a feature or component if it's documented. But expect that if I do change a documented feature or component, that the associated documentation will be updated with the change.
