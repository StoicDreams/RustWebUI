We are very excited to be sharing this tool with you, as well as our journey into the world of Rust development.

One of our last major projects at Stoic Dreams was working on a UI framework utilizing the C# Blazor framework, which allows for C# code and Razor pages to be compiled to webassembly, thus allowing for C# native libraries and code to be used for developing front-end web applications.

This was a very interesting framework for us, as we have always loved the C# language and were very excited by the prospect of having a single language for both front-end and back-end development.

But Blazor is not without it's major issues, which we will not dive into here. But, you can check out our [Blazor UI project](https://blazorui.stoicdreams.com "Blazor UI documentation and website demo") to see for yourself the differences between it and what we're accomplishing here.
