# WebUI Web Components

[WebUI Version: 0.8.4](https://github.com/StoicDreams/WebUI)

This project is a JavaScript/Html/Css only library of web components created as part of WebUI.

While being integrated as part of the WebUI framework, these web components can be used independently of WebUI's Rust-based libraries.

## Goals

Going forward any new components we add to WebUI will be integrated as html/js web components first, and potentially wrapped with a rust interface if there's a benefit seen to doing so.

Also, existing Rust-based WeUI components will be transitioned to html/js web components as I find time to do so. The existing Rust interfaces are expected to be left intact, at least for the short-term.

I'm just starting to dig into the world of web components, so I'm not sure what the end result will be. But I am excited to be getting back to Vanilla JavaScript programming.

## Getting Started
